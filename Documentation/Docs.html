            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome to mini-PS, Our project is an open source mini-PlayStation application that contains 4 open source games <b>(Alien invasion-Flappy Bird - Snake-Tic Tac Toe)</b>,
                whose source code has been Refactored by team members to add the ability to control the settings available in each game by a simple graphical user interface (GUI) Based on Tkinter and PyQt5.<br><br>

                        Visual elements are rendered using native operating system elements, so applications built with tkinter look like they belong on the platform where they’re run.
                        Although tkinter is considered the de-facto Python GUI framework, it’s not without criticism. One notable criticism is that GUIs built with tkinter look outdated.
                        If you want a shiny, modern interface, then tkinter may not be what you’re looking for. so that we used <b>PyQt5.</b>

                        QtGui module contains all the graphical controls. In addition, there are modules for working with XML (QtXml), SVG (QtSvg), and SQL (QtSql).

                        GitHub’s interface is user-friendly enough so even novice coders can take advantage of Git. Without GitHub, using Git generally requires a bit more technical savvy and use of the command line.

                        PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal, and there are several of them. A PEP is a document that describes new features proposed for Python and documents aspects of Python, like design and style, for the community.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have used <b>SQLITE3</b> database, In it we store some user information such as first and last name, username, e-mail and password, and all this data is of TEXT data type.<br><br>
            This data is requested from the new user <b>signup_frame.py</b> and then we add it to the database.
            In the <b>signin_frame.py</b> frame, we ask the user for the user name and password to verify that he is registered in the program data and to be able to make an evaluation of the program.<br><br>
            <b>username</b> and <b>email_address</b> are the primary keys in this table <b>`users_info`</b> and can never be repeated throughout the entire table.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the file pictured above is one of the parts of the installation file code.
            This code is an example of <b>`manipulating files`</b> and it is one of the conditions required in the project.
            This code creates a file that contains all the paths in the program and is considered the link between the design and the code.
            There is more than one file with the same format and idea within the program files, such as the game settings files, and they are 4 files.

                The Open Documentation button will display the file you are reading now, and the Visit Repository button will open the project's repository on GitHub.

                The Feedback button takes simple information from the user and sends his message to us on the project's e-mail.

                The last button takes a copy of the settings and sends it to the user via his e-mail from database.

        <p>
            We collect basic user information such as first and last name, email, username and password, and we also collect event messages in a file.
            All this data is stored on the user's device and we do not deal with it outside this scope, we do not have any accountability in the event of the loss of this data.
        </p>


        <h3>Information usage.</h3>
        <p>
            We do not use this data for any profit purposes or use it in any data analysis, at least until this moment.
            We collect e-mail to send you feedback feedback and current game settings if a backup copy is requested.

        <h3>Information security.</h3>
        <p>
            Users' passwords are stored encrypted and their original text can only be retrieved by the user, so we have programmed a function that does the hashing (SHA256) of the text.
