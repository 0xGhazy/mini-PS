            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome to mini-PS, Our project is an open source mini-PlayStation application that contains 4 open source games <b>(Alien invasion-Flappy Bird - Snake-Tic Tac Toe)</b>,
                whose source code has been Refactored by team members to add the ability to control the settings available in each game by a simple graphical user interface (GUI) Based on Tkinter and PyQt5.<br><br>

                        Visual elements are rendered using native operating system elements, so applications built with tkinter look like they belong on the platform where they’re run.
                        Although tkinter is considered the de-facto Python GUI framework, it’s not without criticism. One notable criticism is that GUIs built with tkinter look outdated.
                        If you want a shiny, modern interface, then tkinter may not be what you’re looking for. so that we used <b>PyQt5.</b>

                        QtGui module contains all the graphical controls. In addition, there are modules for working with XML (QtXml), SVG (QtSvg), and SQL (QtSql).

                        GitHub’s interface is user-friendly enough so even novice coders can take advantage of Git. Without GitHub, using Git generally requires a bit more technical savvy and use of the command line.

                        PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal, and there are several of them. A PEP is a document that describes new features proposed for Python and documents aspects of Python, like design and style, for the community.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have used <b>SQLITE3</b> database, In it we store some user information such as first and last name, username, e-mail and password, and all this data is of TEXT data type.<br><br>
            This data is requested from the new user <b>signup_frame.py</b> and then we add it to the database.
            In the <b>signin_frame.py</b> frame, we ask the user for the user name and password to verify that he is registered in the program data and to be able to make an evaluation of the program.<br><br>
            <b>username</b> and <b>email_address</b> are the primary keys in this table <b>`users_info`</b> and can never be repeated throughout the entire table.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the file pictured above is one of the parts of the installation file code.
            This code is an example of <b>`manipulating files`</b> and it is one of the conditions required in the project.
            This code creates a file that contains all the paths in the program and is considered the link between the design and the code.
            There is more than one file with the same format and idea within the program files, such as the game settings files, and they are 4 files.

        <h3>What data do we collect؟</h3>
        <p>
            As a user, we collect information that has been mentioned in the part of the databases, which is 
            the first and last name, phone number, email, gender, credit card number and its code, as well as the country and password.
        </p>


        <h3>Information usage.</h3>
        <p>
            It does not use this data for any profit or other purpose. What you write on your device stays on 
            your device. You can view the code for the project to make sure, which means that we are not 
            responsible for any data leakage that occurs through this application. Security depends on what has 
            been provided in the program. Data is not tampered with in the database, so the security of your 
            personal device or the security of the network connected to it is the responsibility of the user himself 
            and the development team has no responsibility for what happens.
        </p>

        <h3>Information security.</h3>
        <p>
            All data is stored in the database as plain text, and we put an encryption algorithm that stores 
            the data encrypted inside the database, so no breach process occurs, and all data is leaked, which helps 
            to realize the situation a little faster. The version uploaded to Git Hub contains MD5 Hashing.
